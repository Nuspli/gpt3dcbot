# quickstart:   - go to https://discord.dev
#               - applications -> new application -> set it up
#               - bot -> add bot -> under Privileged Gateway Intents enable "Message content intent" (important)
#               - bot -> reset token: replace "token = os.getenv('BOT_TOKEN')" (line 15) with the token in ''
#               - oauth2 -> not sure if this is necessary, but use in-app and tick bot and applications.commands, admin
#               - -> url-generator -> just select bot and admin -> make a server first and use the link to invite it
#               - now you can use any of the text channels or DM the bot
